# challenge-portfolio

Challenge to implement an artist porfolio site using an existing API. Styling and structure was based on the existing site at the time.

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

The router uses hash routing and I was too lazy to change it, so the following paths will work:

`http://localhost:5000/`

`http://localhost:5000/#/:screenName`

`http://localhost:5000/#/works/:workId`
